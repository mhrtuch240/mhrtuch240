My name is Mahedi Hasan Rafsun, and at just 18 years old, I have already established myself as a professional in the field of web development, programming, SEO, and translation. My passion for technology and an unyielding desire to learn have driven me to achieve expertise in these areas.

I started my journey with web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to build dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites. Along the way, I also developed a strong understanding of SEO, enabling me to optimize websites for better search engine rankings and drive organic traffic.

In addition to my technical skills, I have over two years of experience in translation, working with clients to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps. Whether itâ€™s translating technical documents or creative content, I ensure precision and cultural relevance in every project I take on.

I am also the creator of WebLearner Pro, a platform dedicated to teaching programming and web development in an easy and accessible way. Through my website, app, YouTube channel, and Telegram bot, I aim to provide valuable resources and tutorials for learners of all levels.

Currently, I am working on my book, "Beginner to Advance Programmer," which is designed to guide readers through the journey of learning programming from scratch to advanced levels. The book includes step-by-step tutorials, coding examples, practice exercises, and real-world projects to make learning interactive and practical.

Iâ€™m always striving to grow and help others do the same. My vision is to create opportunities for people to learn, grow, and succeed in the world of technology.

Skills: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, PHP, AND SQL, MYSQL
